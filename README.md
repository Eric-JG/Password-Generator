# Password-Generator
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

#How this app works
The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 128 characters
The user will recieve a confirm for:
Password containing special characters, numbers, and uppercase
Either 4 variables individual ones, or 3 with toLowerCase to Uppercase conversion
This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.
